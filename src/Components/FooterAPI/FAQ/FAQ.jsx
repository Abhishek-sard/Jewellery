          <h1>Is the jewellery certified?</h1>
          <p>
            jewellery in Nepal is not certified byt the government. However, we
            guarantee the purity of our jewellery. The bill will clearly state
            the purity of the jewellery.
          </p>
          <h1>Can I customize the metal in a particular design?</h1>
          <p>
            Yes, we provide all sorts of customization. If you like a design, we
            can make it Rose Gold, White Gold or Yellow Gold. We can also alter
            the designs as per your need.
          </p>
          <h1>Can I customize the color in a particular design?</h1>
          <p>
            Yes, we provide all sorts of customization. If you like a design, we
            can make it Rose Gold, White Gold or Yellow Gold. We can also alter
            the designs as per your need.

          <h1>
            Can I customize the karat/carat purity in a particular design?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Yes, we provide all sorts of customization. If you like a design, we
            can make it in the Karat purity of your choice. However, lesser
            amount of designs can be made in 24 Karat as compared to 22, 18 or
            14 Karat gold.
          </p>
          <h1>Can I customize the gemstone in a particular design?</h1>
          <p>
            Yes, we can change the gemstone in a particular design as well. If
            you like a design but want a different colored stone on it, we will
            happily change it for you.
          </p>
          <h1>
            What does 24 Karat / 22 Karat / 18 Karat / 14 Karat gold mean?
          </h1>
          <p>
            The Karat of a piece of jewellery implies the percentage purity of
            the gold in the jewellery. 24 Karat jewellery is the purest. 24
            Karat jewellery has at least 99.25% Gold Purity, 22 Karat has
            91.664%, 18 Karat has 75% and 14 Karat has 60% Gold purity.
          </p>
          <h1>What are the benefits of 24 Karat gold?</h1>
          <p>
            24 Karat gold is traditionally preferred in Nepali households. It is
            the purest form of gold available. Thus, it is excellent for
            investment purposes. Also, most bridal designs are also made in 24
            Karat gold, proving to be an excellent choice for weddings or
            safekeeping.
          </p>
          <h1>What are the benefits of 22 Karat gold?</h1>
          <p>
            The market trend around the world, and now even Nepal, is moving
            towards 22 Karat gold. Since 22 Karat gold jewellery has a higher
            amount of alloy, the designs are stronger and more intricate. All
            Antique and Temple jewellery are also made in 22 Karat. In general,
            22 Karat is preferred for daily use jewellery or for jewellery with
            high amounts of details, designs and craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <h1>What are the benefits of 18 Karat / 14 Karat gold?</h1>
          <p>
            Much like 22 Karat Jewellery, 18 Karat and 14 Karat gold jewellery
            is also stronger due to the higher amount of alloy. Due to the
            higher alloy, many more designs can be made in 18 Karat and 14
            Karat. Furthermore, this Karat-age of jewellery also allows for
            colors such as Rose Gold and White Gold along with the traditional
            Yellow Gold. Also, since these Karat ranges have higher amount of
            alloys, the cost of the jewellery is also lesser.
          </p>
          <h1>What jewelry purity should I opt for?</h1>
          <p>
            Opting for a certain kind of jewellery is completely a personal
            choice. While we recommend 24 Karat gold for traditional jewellery
            and investment purposes, we recommend 22 Karat jewellery for more
            intricate designs and 18 and 14 Karat jewellery for Rose Gold and
            White Gold colors and budget-friendly options.
